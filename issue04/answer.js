Issue 04

You have the two following arrays:
colors = ["Blue ", "Green", "Red", "Orange", "Violet", "Indigo", "Yellow "];
position = ["th","st","nd","rd"]

In English you have the ordinal numbers to specify positions in a list, for example:
1 - First (st) - means the first item of a list.
2 - Second (nd) - means the second item of a list.
3 - Third (rd) - means the third item of a list.

Only the first three items has special names. The rest you can name as:
4 - Fourth (th) - means the fourth item of a list.
5 - Fiveth (th) - means the fiveth item of a list.
6 - Sixth (th) - means the sixth item of a list.
....
